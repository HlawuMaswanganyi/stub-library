#How to run the app

Hi stub(with a small 's'), just double click the html file.

##Possible improvements

- Maybe no need to add multiple template/statement type handlers, but I wanted you to see my big thinking. Don't miss my humility here!
- Maybe the table could be all together generated on the library with no need to pass a table element id. But I am not sure that would have been best? Because we would have to add it at the end of the body element and the user would have to deal with position and styling it to place it where they want it.
- Remove duplicate line items or simply sum up the figure for those.

##Proud of

- Simplicity of getting the library to work. Simply include it, instantiate, then joy!
- Getting this to work given that I am not an accountant, had little data/instructions to work with.
- Writing code for stub.

##Enjoyed

- Writing pure Js, for stub.
