# How to run the app

Hi stub(with a small 's'), either visit: https://stub-profit-loss-generator.netlify.app/ or double click the html file.

## Possible improvements

- Maybe no need to add multiple template/statement type handlers, but I wanted you to see my big thinking. Don't miss my humility here!

## Proud of

- Simplicity of getting the library to work. Simply include it, instantiate, then joy!
- Getting this to work given that I am not an accountant, had little data/instructions to work with.
- Writing code for stub.

## Enjoyed

- Writing pure Js, for stub.
